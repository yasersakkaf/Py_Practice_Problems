### Problem Statement

There is an apartment which is designed in a way where we have N floors and each floor has M flats. On each floor there are few flats which have stairs that can take you upstairs or downstairs, which are marked as 1 and few which do not have stairs and are marked as 0. You can go to the next floor through a flat which has stairs in them and on a floor you can go in and out of any flat. Ram is an old man and is in some flat. Now he wants to go to the Kth flat of the ith floor but his knees hurt and he wants to traverse minimum number of flats to go that flat. He has the layout of the apartment with him but due to his age he cannot perform this calculation. Help ram find the right path to traverse to reach the Kth flat.
